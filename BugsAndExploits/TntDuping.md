# tnt duplication

## History
TNT Duplication, or TNT Duping, was first discovered in 1.7 but was not used as it was slightly impractical before the addition of slime blocks. It gained popularity for the first time when upcoming technical Minecraft player ilmango released a video on YouTube entitled "The BEST Way To Make Perimeters in Minecraft," showcasing a slimestone flying machine that used flying TNT Dupers and liquid clearing machines to create a large hole fully automatically.
## Mechanic
TNT Duping works by using piston pushing behavior to make the TNT both light and move at once, creating a moving TNT block and a TNT entity. The order this follows is:
The piston, in the same tick it powers but before moving, creates a list of the blocks in front of it that need to be moved.
The TNT gets powered. In order to do this, the update that powers it needs to come from a moving rail (1.12 and below), a moving coral fan (1.13+)(specifically a moving block replacing the block supporting the coral fan), or a moving lit observer (works in all versions that have observers), which needs to happen before the TNT block is removed (before a block behind the tnt replaces it, or if there is no blocks, it can be after the moving TNT was created). 
These specific blocks are able to update after the list of blocks to be moved is created, but before the blocks have moved. This update can also be propagated through other blocks, as long as it is instant (for example using rails, dust, noteblocks (1.13+), or TNT itself), which allows for up to 11 TNT to be duplicated using a single piston push, the 12th block being for updating.
In this step, the TNT entity has already been created from step 2, so now the piston actually moves the blocks it already has in the list, and this means that the TNT is preserved in block form.
Opposition
Mojang historically opposes TNT Duping as they consider it an exploit, but have decided to leave it in the game for the time being, 
due to a lack of replacement method
