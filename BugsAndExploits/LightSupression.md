# Light Suppression

Light update suppression is the delaying of light updates and then stopping the server to effectively delete them.

## Technical explanation
When a block being moved, placed, or broken a light update is produced. These light updates are placed in a queue for the light thread to process. Then when the light thread gets to that update it processes it and the light level is changed in the world. Light Suppression works by filling that queue with other light updates; delaying the processing of them. When the server is stopped any unprocessed light updates are deleted and thereby not processed, so the light level is wrong. 

## Use
1. A light suppression machine is run. This typically consists of flashing redstone lamps or, in older light update suppressors, moving blocks. Light updates from light sources typically take longer to process.
2. After approximately 20k light updates are in the queue the machine is stopped. Normally the length of queue is around 3 seconds because if it were any longer the server will slow down to let the light thread catch up. 
3. A light update that is to be deleted is produced.
4. The server is stopped either through the `/stop` command or crashing with an update suppressor. Results with `/stop` can be inconsistent so `/save-all flush` can be ran before to fix that. 

## History
In 1.17 a basic form of thread syncing was added limiting the light queue to about 20,000 light updates. Previously the light update queue was could be as big as the server's allocated memory.
